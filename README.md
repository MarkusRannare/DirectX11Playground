# MoRE

MoRE stands for Molly Rendering Engine, and the name comes from our daughter that was born when I started coding the engine.
It's just me trying to understand rendering technology better by implementing it. If someone can learn something from this, then
I will be very happy. But most likely, you are better of with a better rendering engine like Irrlicht (http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/) or
Ogre (https://www.ogre3d.org/). If you are into games, you are most likely even better of with a engine like Unreal Engine 4 or Unity.
